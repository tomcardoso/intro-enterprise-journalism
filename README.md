This talk was originally given virtually for [Shared Bylines](https://www.sharedbylines.com/) on October 13, 2021. Here's a brief description:

> The Globe and Mail's Tom Cardoso is here to talk about enterprise journalism: what it means to find and pitch enterprise stories, how to make an engaging story out of your data or research, and how to stay organized on big projects. He'll also be able to answer questions about some of his recent work, such as the Bias Behind Bars investigation and his reporting on the Catholic Church's role in residential schools.
