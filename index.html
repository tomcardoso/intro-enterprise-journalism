					<h2>What is enterprise journalism?</h2>
					<p>(It’s often – but not always – a synonym for investigative reporting.)</p>
				</section>

				<section class="pull-left">
					<p>At its heart, enterprise or investigative work is about <span class="highlight-burgundy">accountability</span> and <span class="highlight-burgundy">impact</span>. What do we mean by this?</p>
					<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Work that holds the powerful – systems, organizations or individuals – accountable.</p>
					<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Work that leaves a mark with readers, and leads to <strong>meaningful change</strong>. That could be through anything from legislative change, to court action, to a change in the circumstances of the people you’re reporting on.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What does enterprise reporting look like for a reporter?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>First, it is often (but not always) <span class="highlight-burgundy">slow</span>. Even when you’re moving quickly, it could be months before you publish anything.</li>
						<li>It is <span class="highlight-burgundy">research-heavy</span>. You can expect to spend much of your time digging up documents, having background conversations with sources and just generally thumbing around in the dark.</li>
						<li>It’s often <span class="highlight-burgundy">lonely</span>. You may be working on a topic that only a handful of people in the country actively study or care about in an in-depth way.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>But, above all: it is deeply rewarding and exciting.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Enterprise journalism differs from beat reporting in one crucial way: If you’re working as an enterprise reporter, you may have no background on a particular topic until you begin working on it. Enterprise reporters have to be comfortable <span class="highlight-burgundy">quickly becoming experts on a given topic</span>.</p>
					<p>In other words: When working on an investigative story, you’ll need to <strong>pick up the phone</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>While it’s not easy to boil down investigative work to a few basic modes, here’s a (poor) attempt:</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>The “here’s the answer to something we’ve all been wondering about” story.</strong> Example: The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html">NYT’s years-long investigation into Donald Trump’s tax returns</a>. Stories like this often require throwing yourself at a question repeatedly, until you finally get an answer.</li>
						<li><strong>The “we have quantified something previously unknowable.”</strong> My colleague Robyn Doolittle’s <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-power-gap-main/">Power Gap series</a> for The Globe is a recent example, or my <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-investigation-racial-bias-in-canadian-prison-risk-assessments/">Bias Behind Bars series</a> last year on systemic racism in federal prison.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>The “here’s a deep, deep dive into something arcane and messed up.”</strong> Reporters at ProPublica in the U.S. are masters at this. Great recent example: A story of how a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-one-trump-tax-cut-meant-to-help-the-poor-a-billionaire-ended-up-winning-big">technical error in an obscure Treasury Department map</a> meant hundreds of millions for a U.S. CEO.</li>
						<li><strong>The “we’ve got a ton of documents.”</strong> Think: <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/">Panama/Paradise/Pandora Papers</a>. This often focuses on decoding a large document dump for readers.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>The profile.</strong> The reporter unpacks a newsworthy person, organization or thing. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one">This New Yorker piece on an inevitable earthquake</a> that will devastate the Pacific Northwest is a great example.</li>
						<li><strong>The yarn.</strong> Sometimes, the value of the investigation is in the storytelling itself. Writers like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/04/a-murder-foretold">David Grann</a> and <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/">Patrick Radden Keefe</a> exceed at this.</li>
						<li><strong>The bombshell.</strong> A story so explosive it speaks for itself. The <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-pmo-pressed-justice-minister-to-abandon-prosecution-of-snc-lavalin/">piece in The Globe that set off the SNC-Lavalin affair</a> is a great example.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="pull-left" style="font-size: 0.8em;">(And of course, most of these stories are a mix of all the above!)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What does enterprise reporting look like for a reader?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Investigative journalism is explanatory in nature.</strong> Part of the reporter’s job is to unpack a hard-to-comprehend topic for a lay audience.</p>
					<p><strong>The writing is compelling.</strong> Enterprise isn’t simply about banging out a few thousand words and calling it a day – you’ll spend time on your craft, fleshing out characters and keeping the reader engaged.</p>
					<p><strong>It’s often serialized.</strong> You’ve just spent months (or years!) working on a topic. Inevitably, several follow-up story ideas have tumbled out of your reporting.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Developing and pitching an enterprise project</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>First thing to know: There is no one-size-fits-all.</p>
					<p>Everyone’s process is different. Some like to focus on one topic at a time and go hard. Others (like me!) like to keep several balls in the air and only move forward with the topics that feel right.</p>
					<p>It’s okay to know nothing about a topic when you’re starting. In fact, that’s the default mode for investigative reporters.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
					<p>What am I interested in? What have I always wondered about?</p>
					<p>It’s unlikely you’ll know about some egregious wrongdoing or whatnot right off the bat, so instead try and work from your interests. (Or, go the other way and learn a lot about something you know nothing about but have always been fascinated by!)</p>
					<p>Given you’re still starting out, you won’t have any sources yet. That’s okay! It’s a life-long effort.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Instead, mine for ideas.</p>
					<p>If you don’t yet know how to, <a href="https://github.com/tomcardoso/foi-basics">learn how to file freedom of information requests</a>. In the meantime, <a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/search/ati">check out what others have filed</a> (and request those same documents)!</p>
					<p>If you’re interested in it, learn how to do <a href="https://datajournalism.com/watch/cleaning-data-in-excel">basic data analysis</a>, which will unlock all sorts of stories.</p>
					<p>Local news stories are great, and often point to systemic issues worth investigating.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Protip:</p>
					<p>Avoid getting yourself into “noun projects.” These are ideas that sound like a person just threw out a random noun at a meeting, like “auto loans” or “the police.” You should be more focused than that. What about the police? What about car loans?</p>
					<p>Even seasoned reporters fall into this trap!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>You’ve found an idea, and it has legs. Now what?</h2>
					<p>(This is where the rubber hits the road. As I said before: <span class="highlight-burgundy">pick up the phone.</span>)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>You should expect to have many conversations <strong>on background</strong>. This gives you a chance to figure out what do and don’t know, and to build a list of sources.</p>
					<p>Start simple: reach out to 3 to 5 people that are experts on your topic. Have a phone call with each. At the end of every conversation, ask who else they’d recommend you speak to.</p>
					<p>Before you know it, you’ll have dozens of names in your rolodex. (It’s not unusual to build out close to 100 sources on complex, longer investigations!)</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<p>At the same time, you should be doing plenty of reading. What kinds of documents do you need? Are they public? If not, can you file a freedom of information request for them, or get a (newly-acquired) source to share them with you?</p>
					<p>(Note: Not all stories need to take forever. Sometimes, it could be just days or weeks. My most recent investigative series, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-catholic-church-canadian-assets-investigation/">an examination of the Catholic Church’s finances and its dealings with residential school survivors</a>, began with a story that took roughly six weeks to produce.)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>On staying organized</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>One of the most frustrating feelings during an investigation is that of being <strong>“in the weeds.”</strong></p>
					<p>Feeling lost within a story idea is incredibly frustrating – but it’s also an important part of working through the story in your mind.</p>
					<p>I’m often digesting a story idea during dog walks, in the shower, while cooking, etc.</p>
					<p>Some tips on how to deal with this:</p>
				</section>

				<section class="pull-left">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Write a draft.</strong> The holes in your story become painfully obvious once you’ve written a draft.</li>
						<li><strong>What is your nut graf?</strong> If you can’t answer this or pitch the story to an editor in under a minute, you have more refining to do. When in doubt, keep digging.</li>
						<li><strong>Keep detailed notes of your calls.</strong> The key to your story may be buried in a notebook from several months ago.</li>
						<li><strong>Know when to call it.</strong> Sometimes, the idea just doesn’t work. Know when to shelve it or move on. You can always come back to it later.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>On writing and presentation</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>At a certain point, you’ll exhaust your sources, become an expert on the topic and your findings will be clear. Time to write!</p>
					<p>Remember: <strong>Always think about impact.</strong> What kind of effect do you want your story to have? Who should be reading it? Write with those things in mind.</p>
					<p>You should <strong>present solutions.</strong> It’s not enough to simply expose a wrong – accountability requires that you lay out the path to fixing it.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="pull-left">
					<p>With an investigation, you may be looking at thousands of words. At these lengths, you need to plan your stories carefully. Ask yourself:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Who are my characters? How do I make them come to life?</li>
						<li>Can I use narrative journalism techniques to pull readers through the story? How does that affect my interviews?</li>
						<li>Do I have a plan for how I’m structuring this story? Have I written that plan out?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Then there’s the <strong>accountability letter.</strong> You should document your investigation, explain your findings clearly and give your subjects ample time for comment (this could be a week or longer if the subject matter is complex enough).</p>
					<p>These letters can easily take up several thousand words. <strong>Expect questions,</strong> and document (and record) your communications with the subject carefully. This is important both for your own files, and for legal reasons! (A sternly-worded letter in response from a lawyer is always a possibility.)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Finally, an under-considered point: Think about how you want your story presented.</p>
					<p>What kinds of photos could you assign (or take yourself)? What about graphics? Video? Audio? Digital and print presentation?</p>
					<p>You’re the person closest to the story. Your opinion here matters!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>And, once the story’s out:</p>
					<p><strong>Keep the pressure on!</strong> One of the hardest parts of running an investigation is staying on top of the file and keeping the subject accountable. What is the government’s reaction to your story? What are political leaders’, or experts? Get them on the record for a follow story.</p>
